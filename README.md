# Groundhog

Groundhog is a plugin for the Grasshopper parametric design platform.

## Installation

## Use

## Building

#### OS X



#### Windows

Note to prevent hardcoding a Windows App Data UDID I've just copy/pasted Grasshopper.dll and GH_IO.dll into C:\Program Files (x86)\Rhinoceros 5\System\. You'll need to do the same or go into groundhog.csproj and change the reference paths.

## Contributions & Feedback

Both are welcome.
