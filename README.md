Groundhog is a [Grasshopper plugin](http://grasshopper3d.com), a set of reference models, and wiki exploring the applications of computational design techniques in landscape architecture. Groundhog is currently in beta. The plugin and associated site will be updated with more features and information in early 2018.

Please visit [www.groundhog.la](http://groundhog.la) for documentation and examples of how to use the plugin and for resources on computational approaches to landscape architectural design in general.

## Plugin Setup

#### Requirements

- Rhinoceros 5.0 or 6.0 (Windows)
- Rhinoceros WIP (Mac)
- Grasshopper 0.9.0076, although it should work on newer and slightly older versions

#### Installation

1. The plugin can be download at [groundhog.la](http://groundhog.la/plugin/). Once you have unzipped the associated file, the "plugin" file is `groundhog.gha`.
2. If you are on Windows you will right-click on the plugin file, open the properties tab, then in the properties window click the unblock option in the bottom right corner. For more details, refer to [this guide](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/delay/p/unblockingdownloadedfile/).
3. Open up Grasshopper, then in the "File" menu go to "Special Folders" and then "Components Folder"
4. Copy the plugin file to this folder, then quit Rhinoceros/Grasshopper.
5. When you reopen Rhinoceros/Grasshopper there should be a "Groundhog" tab present.
