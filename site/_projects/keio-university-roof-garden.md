The most visible impact of computational design techniques on the design of landscapes is often in the formal treatment of 'hard' surfaces — street furniture, paving elements, pavilions, and other items that can be manufactured specifically for a particular project. As manufactured and constructed artefacts, these elements can draw from the design and fabrication techniques popularised for creating architectural forms.

For example, Michel Desvigne's *Keio University Roof* project employs a 'field' technique whereby a parametric grid of circles has their radii grown in response to an image map. These apertures then become voids within the paving grid and filled with plants or stone cylinders that function as seats.[@Corner:2009jg 173] The resulting aesthetic is one of a smoothly differentiated surface with semi-enclosed areas that reflects the that form a braided river in plan; an image used to drive the geometric layout:

> "One slips into this space, drifting along on the feelings aroused by the water and the light, playing on the same logic. There is no clear separation here (nor was there in Noguchi's garden) between voids and solids. This composition plays with successive planes and textures of variable densities. The even punctuation of the ground gives cadence to these variations. This is a small structure that organizes textures, porosities, densities, and transparencies—the material and the complex spaces, just as in a natural landscape." [@Corner:2009jg 175]

The project’s goals are a productive contradiction: a desire for a roof garden — a tightly bounded and sculptured landscape — that at the same time displays the variety of a traditional Japanese garden. The concrete nature of the variations perhaps constrain the ability for this garden to change over time, but this is to be expected given its programme and roof-top position. However this highlights the possibility for the paving form and vegetated form to be more tightly integrated: the extent to which the choice of plants relates to this original system is unclear, and largely seems split between small trees and low-lying grass/shrub patterns. Presumably these were manually selected given the small size of the design; but how would such an approach work at scale?
